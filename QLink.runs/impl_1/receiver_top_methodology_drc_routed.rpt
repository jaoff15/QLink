2. REPORT DETAILS

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock SpiClk/spi_clk_gen_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock CLK100_I and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks CLK48_O and clk_out1_spi_clk_gen_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks CLK48_O] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_spi_clk_gen_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT SpiTx/ODDR_MOSI_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock SpiClk/spi_clk_gen_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin SpiClk/spi_clk_gen_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
